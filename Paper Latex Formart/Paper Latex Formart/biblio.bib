abstract = {We use a Laguerre--Gaussian laser mode within an optical tweezers arrangement to demonstrate the transfer of the orbital angular momentum of a laser mode to a trapped particle. The particle is optically confined in three dimensions and can be made to rotate; thus the apparatus is an optical spanner. We show that the spin angular momentum of {\textpm}ℏ per photon associated with circularly polarized light can add to, or subtract from, the orbital angular momentum to give a total angular momentum. The observed cancellation of the spin and orbital angular momentum shows that, as predicted, a Laguerre--Gaussian mode with an azimuthal mode index l$=$1 has a well-defined orbital angular momentum corresponding to ℏ per photon.},
